# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN
- Outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic has created various changes in the lifestyle of everyone around the world. 
- In those changes wearing a mask has been very vital to every individual. 
- Detection of people who are not wearing masks is a challenge due to the large number of populations. 
- This project can be used in schools, hospitals, banks, airports etc as a digitalized scanning tool. 
-The technique of detecting peopleâ€™s faces and segregating them into two classes namely the people with masks and people without masks is done with the help of image processing and deep learning. 
- With the help of this project, a person who is intended to monitor the people can be seated in a remote area and still can monitor efficiently and give instructions accordingly.
- Various libraries of python such as OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras. 
- In Deep Learning Convolution Neural Networks is a class Deep Neural Networks which is used to train the models used for this project.
